# GPS-Triangle-FRSKY
Application for tracking models on triangles using FRSKY Bluetooth telemetry.
Continuing with the Frsky Tracking project, I have created an application to carry out the GPS triangle competition using FRSKY's Bluetooth telemetry.
It is based on the existing programs to carry out this competition but in a simplified way. It allows, like the first application, using a GPS and a Variometer to track and count the number of turns of an airplane using FRSKY's telemetry via Bluetooth.

It is currently in the testing phase but will soon be open to the public.
