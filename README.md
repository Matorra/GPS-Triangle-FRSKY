# GPS-Triangle-FRSKY
Application for tracking models on triangles using FRSKY Bluetooth telemetry.
Continuing with the Frsky Tracking project, I have created an application to carry out the GPS triangle competition using FRSKY's Bluetooth telemetry.
It is based on the existing programs to carry out this competition but in a simplified way. It allows, like the first application, using a GPS and a Variometer to track and count the number of turns of an airplane using FRSKY's telemetry via Bluetooth.
